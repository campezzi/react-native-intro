# react-native-intro

This is the result of a live coding session where I demoed React Native to a few co-workers. The main goal of the session was to showcase a typical React Native development workflow while creating a simple master-detail application that runs on iOS and Android. It illustrates the use of two crucial components on the React Native package: `ListView` and `Navigator`.

## Instructions

- Make sure you have installed the React Native CLI and its dependencies. Detailed instructions can be found here: https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html

- Run `npm install` on the project root folder to install React Native and all its dependencies

- Run `react-native start` to start the React Native Packager

- To build and run the iOS app: `react-native run-ios`

- To build and run the Android app: ensure an Android simulator is running (i.e. a Genymotion virtual device) and run `react-native run-android`

- Hit Cmd+D (iOS simulator) or the Menu button (Android simulator) to bring up the Developer Menu and enable LiveReload, start a Chrome debugging session, etc.

- Have fun!
